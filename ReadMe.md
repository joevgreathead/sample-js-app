# Sample JS App

## A new update to pull in!

This is a sample JS app to show off a few things like npm usage and app structure.

Each branch in this repo is a next step in the path. After this comes `step-01`. Steps 2 and onwards branch in two different directions. Both have the value of:

- Fast reload or compilation of assets.
- Built in commands to build optimized, ready assets that can be deployed to a real server. (Some optimizations may still be needed for more complex apps.)
- `npm` and `webpack` style management of dependencies, assets, and build pipeline.

Branch path `-a`:

- Focuses on jQuery style applications.
- Useful for those familiar to more plain JavaScript style, jQuery usage, and using HTML/CSS directly.
- Can be deployed on just about any server without specific requirements because the output is optimized HTML and JS files.

Branch path `-b`:

- Focuses on React style "single page" application.
- Useful for more complex application style interfaces.
- Can be deployed to just about any server, but may require optimizations like proxying sub view requests to main "/" path.
